Building using script "build.sh"

For Molpro-like calculations:
* subsystem B must have ghost basis functions for all atoms in subsystem A
* subsystem A may/may not have ghost basis functions, depending on whether
  you're performing a basis set truncation
* use option embed/localize
* use option embed/freezeb
* set option embed/cycles 1
* set option embed/subcycles n (where n > 1)

For "regular" freeze-and-thaw:
* both subsystems may/may not have ghost basis functions,
  depending on whether you're performing a basis set truncation
* remove embed/localize
* remove embed/freezeb
* set option embed/cycles n (n > 1)
* set option embed/subcycles 1

For "absolute localization" freeze-and-thaw
* make sure there are no ghost basis functions on either subystem
* remove embed/localize
* remove embed/freezeb
* set option embed/cycles n (n > 1)
* set option embed/subcycles 1
